# Poll Position

How hard is it to get to your polling place? How hard would it be to get there if you didn't have access to reliable tranportation? That's the question Poll Position seeks to answer.

Poll position is a game, but it's a serious game.

## Potential Remixes

You could take the source code from this project and turn it into a look at the distance between, well, pretty much any two things, with minimal effort. How far are children from their schools? How far are workers from their jobs? How far are you from the nearst play to get Fourth Meal? The possibilities are endless.

## Contributing

I'm a hobbyist, not a developer. My day job doesn't require much coding, and when it does, I can get away with code that's pretty gross. Hence, this code is pretty gross. Feel free to make it better.
